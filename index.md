The platform, let's call it “Thoughtful Therapy," could have three main
components: a gaming section for people with depression, an exercise
section for older adults, and a health tracking feature that reminds
users to drink water and take their medication on time.
Gaming Section for People with Depression
❖ The gaming section could include a variety of games that are
designed to help people with depression, such as puzzle games,
adventure games, or even virtual reality experiences.
❖ These games could be designed to help users build confidence,
develop problem-solving skills, and improve their mood.
❖ The platform could also include a social feature that allows users to
connect with others who are going through similar experiences,
providing a sense of community and support.
Exercise Section for Older Adults
❖ The exercise section could include a variety of exercises that are
tailored to older adults, such as yoga, tai chi, or even simple
stretching exercises.
❖ These exercises could be designed to help improve flexibility,
balance, and strength, reducing the risk of falls and other injuries.
❖ The platform could also include a feature that allows users to track
their progress, set goals, and receive rewards for achieving
milestones.
Health Tracking Feature
❖ The health tracking feature could include reminders for users to drink
water and take their medication on time.
❖ The platform could also allow users to track their health metrics, such
as blood pressure, heart rate, and other vital signs.
❖ This feature could be integrated with wearable devices or other health
tracking tools, providing users with a comprehensive view of their
health.
